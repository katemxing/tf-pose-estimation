Hey! This is a clone of the tf-pose-estimation by Ildoo Kim modified to work with Tensorflow 2.0+, modified for Docker containerization, and left out all the GUI interface.

It can now output a .json file for each frame (modified according to https://github.com/ArashHosseini/tf-pose-estimation).

Link to the original repo: https://www.github.com/ildoonet/tf-openpose

Install: https://take6shin-tech-diary.com/openpose-tensorflow2/

Output to .json: https://github.com/ArashHosseini/tf-pose-estimation
