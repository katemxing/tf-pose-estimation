Hey! This is a clone of the tf-pose-estimation by Ildoo Kim modified to work with Tensorflow 2.0+, modified for Docker containerization, and remove all the GUI interface (for run.py and run_video.py only).

It can now output a .json file for each frame (modified according to https://github.com/ArashHosseini/tf-pose-estimation).

Output to .json: https://github.com/ArashHosseini/tf-pose-estimation
